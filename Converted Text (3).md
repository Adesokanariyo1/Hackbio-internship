Overview

Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumors. If left unchecked, the tumors can spread throughout the body and become fatal. (World Health Organization, 2020) 

Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumors that cause lumps or thickening. Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal. “Cancer that develops in the cells of the breast. It is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women.”  Chlebowski RT, et al. 2023

Incidence and Prevalence 

\- Globally: 2.3 million new cases diagnosed in 2020 (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2020)

\- In the USA: 287,850 new cases expected in 2022 (American Cancer Society 2024)

\- The Prevalence of breast cancer is high in developed countries and lower in developing countries (Ferlay et al 2018)

According to the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN 2020), breast cancer accounted for approximately 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths globally in 2020.

     A  lot of Factors are associated with Breast Cancer ; Hormones, Genetics, Diet, Radiation Exposure, Access to healthcare to mention a few. Screening and early breast clinical examination plays a major role and crucial outcomes in the mitigation of breast cancer. 

Cohort Studies: These studies follow groups of individuals over time to assess risk factors and outcomes.

Case-Control Studies: These studies compare individuals with breast cancer to those without to identify potential risk factors.

Meta-Analyses: Aggregating data from multiple studies provides stronger evidence regarding risk factors and treatment efficacy.

Epidemiological Studies and Findings on Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is one of the most studied cancers in epidemiology due to its prevalence and impact on women’s health.(Budny A, et al.) Numerous studies have identified risk factors, protective factors, and trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality.

Important Findings

1\. Risk Factor 

   - Genetic Factors: Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes significantly increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Women with these mutations have a lifetime risk of up as high as 80%.

   - Hormonal Factors: Prolonged exposure to estrogen, whether from early menstruation, late menopause, even hormone replacement therapy, is associated with increased risk of breast cancer.

   - Lifestyle Factors: Alcohol consumption, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle are linked to higher breast cancer risk and cancer generally.

2\. Protective factors:

   - Physical Activity: Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer in research works on breast cancer.

   - Breastfeeding: Women who breastfeed have a lower risk of developing breast cancer, most likely due to hormonal changes and reduced menstrual cycles.

   - Diet: A meal rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may provide protective benefits.

3\. Incidence and Mortality Trends:

   - Geographic Variations: Incidence rates vary worldwide, with higher rates in North America and Europe compared to Asia and Africa. This variation is often attributed to lifestyle and reproductive factors.

   - Screening Impact: Mammography screening has led to early detection, reducing mortality rates in many populations with breast cancer. Mao X, et al. 2023.

4\. Socioeconomic Factors: 

   - Access to education, standard healthcare, and socioeconomic status significantly influence breast cancer outcomes, with disparities observed in diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion 

Breast cancer remains a significant public health concern worldwide, affecting millions and their families. Understanding its epidemiology is crucial for developing effective prevention, screening, and control strategies. Studies have identified several critical risk factors for breast cancer, including genetic predispositions (such as BRCA mutations), hormonal influences, and lifestyle choices. 

     Notable factors like alcohol consumption, obesity and lack of physical activity have been linked to increased risk. On the other hand factors such as breastfeeding, physical activity, and a healthy diet can help mitigate this risk of breast cancer. Geographic and socioeconomic disparities in incidence and outcomes highlight the need for targeted interventions. Advancements in screening, particularly mammography, have proven effective in reducing mortality rates through early detection. Anastasiadi Z, et al. 2017

Future research should aim to: 

• Identifying new risk factors and biomarkers to enhance understanding and detection Health Organizations and Agencies should work on creating tailored screening and prevention strategies to suit individual needs.

• Reducing healthcare disparities and improving outcomes for marginalized communities should be a top priority for international Health agencies

• Public health initiatives should prioritize collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and community organizations to address disparities and improve access to care.

• Investigating the role of environmental factors and lifestyle changes over time will be essential. Additionally, studies focusing on the impact of emerging technologies in screening and treatment can enhance early detection and personalized care. 

Finally, the fight against breast cancer requires ongoing dedication and collaboration across all sectors of society. Together, we can reduce the burden of this disease and improve the lives of those affected by Cancer.
